By calculating the voronoi diagram of a set of line and arc segments it is easy to find offsets to the original segments.

This is explained (in a rather complex way) by Martin Held in his book **On the computational  geometry of pocket machining**

A somewhat simpler description is given by Lambregts et al.

Jeong et al. also discuss pocketing via voronoi diagrams
